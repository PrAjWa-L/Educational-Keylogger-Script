# üõ†Ô∏è Educational Keylogger (Red Team Simulation Project)

## üß† Overview

This is a simple but functional Python-based keylogger designed for **educational purposes**, **red team simulation**, and **ethical hacking labs**. It demonstrates core concepts of input capture (MITRE ATT&CK T1056.001) and stealth execution on Windows systems.

## üì¶ Features

- Captures all printable characters and special keys (Enter, Space, Tab, etc.)
- Logs output to a text file (`log.txt`)
- Runs silently when converted to `.exe`
- Optionally simulates persistence via registry (Windows)
- Works in controlled red team labs and sandbox environments

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git
- Windows or Linux (demo designed for Windows lab use)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the repository, set up the environment, and run the keylogger:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PrAjWa-L/Educational-Keylogger-Script.git
cd Educational-Keylogger-Script

# 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install pynput

# 4. Run the keylogger
python keylogger.py
```
The script logs all keystrokes into (`log.txt`) in the current directory.
Stop it anytime with (`Ctrl + C`).

## üí£ Convert to Executable (Windows Payload Simulation)

Package the script as a stealth executable for red team testing:

```bash
# 1. Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# 2. Build the executable (stealth mode)
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile keylogger.py
```
The executable will be created in the (`dist/`) directory as (`keylogger.exe.`)
This (`.exe`) runs silently in the background.
